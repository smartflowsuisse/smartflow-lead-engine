## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/leads` | List all leads |
| POST | `/api/leads` | Create a new lead |
| GET | `/api/leads/:id` | Get lead with analysis |
| PATCH | `/api/leads/:id` | Update lead |
| DELETE | `/api/leads/:id` | Delete lead |
| POST | `/api/leads/:id/analyze` | Run AI website analysis |
| GET | `/api/stats` | Dashboard statistics |
| GET | `/api/pipeline` | Pipeline grouped by status |

## AI Website Analysis (v1)

AI enrichment is **disabled by default**. The app always runs the heuristic analyzer; when enabled with a provider API key, an LLM can refine quick wins, automation opportunities, and the executive summary.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:

```bash
AI_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=false   # set true to enable LLM enrichment
AI_PROVIDER=openai          # openai | anthropic
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Numeric scores always come from the heuristic engine in v1. Without an API key, analysis behavior is unchanged.

## Lead Scoring

Scores range from **0 to 100** based on:

- Website quality (20%)
- Mobile friendliness (15%)
- Page speed (15%)
- SEO basics (15%)
- Trust elements (15%)
- Missing contact form bonus (+5)
- Quick win opportunities (+2 each, max 15)
- Automation opportunities (+1 each, max 5)

Higher scores indicate stronger SmartFlow sales opportunities.

## CRM Pipeline Stages

1. **New Lead** — Just added, not yet analyzed
2. **Analyzed** — AI analysis complete
3. **Contacted** — Initial outreach sent
4. **Follow Up** — Awaiting response
5. **Proposal Sent** — SmartFlow proposal delivered
6. **Client** — Converted customer
